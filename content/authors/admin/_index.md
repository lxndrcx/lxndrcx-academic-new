I am a computer science student at The Australian National University. I enjoy learning about logic, solving interesting problems and going for nature walks. I'm mostly interested in the formal side of computer science, such as software verification and functional programming.

I am also a Zen student in the Diamond Sangha, studying under [Allan Marett](https://allanmarett.com).
